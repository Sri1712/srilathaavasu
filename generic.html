								<h2>Water Body Channel Identification Using Convolutional Neural Network  </h2>
									
								<p> The process of water body extraction plays a crucial role in various fields such as water resource 
									investigation, flood monitoring, agriculture, wetland protection, and disaster prevention. Accurately 
									identifying and delineating water bodies from satellite or aerial imagery can provide valuable 
									information for effective planning and management of resources and infrastructure.</p>
								<p> With the advancements in remote sensing technology, there are now various methods available for 
									extracting water bodies. These methods include the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), 
									multiband spectral relationship method, and single-band threshold method.</p>
								<p> The existing methods use spectral based features only which is not sufficient to separate water 
									bodies from other features accurately. This project proposes an automatic approach based on 
									fully convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying water body with the learning of 
									discriminative spatial features.</p>
								<p>	The proposed work is tested with Cross Channel Normalization (CCN) and Batch Normalization 
									(BN). In addition, CNN has proven to be highly effective in differentiating between water and 
									clouds, as well as mountain shadows.</p>

								<h2>BoomBikes Linear Regression Case Study</h2>

								<p> BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider in the US, is facing a significant revenue downturn due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
									As the economy begins to recover, the company is looking to understand how bike demand may shift and prepare for a surge in usage. 
									To achieve this, BoomBikes has contracted a consulting firm to analyze various factors influencing the demand for shared bikes. 
									Using a dataset containing daily bike demand information, the goal is to model and predict bike demand based on different variables. 
									This model will help BoomBikes optimize its business strategies and adapt to customer needs in a post-pandemic market.</p>
